### Abstract   
Guess the randomly generated number with minimal iteration steps.

### Our case
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer "spit" randomly generated integer number in a range from 0 to 100, and we need to guess that. By "guess" I mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm uses information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**     
The results rate by the value of average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What I practice**     
* Learning to write good code on python
* Learning to work with IDE.
* Learning to work with GitHub.
